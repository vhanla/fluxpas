FluxPas
---------
This is a simple tool for Linux (tested on Gnome Ubuntu x86_64) to interact with xflux.

Compile with Lazarus Pascal, it only requires two files: xflux and icon.ico apart from the generated executable.

It uses the trayicon, so if you are using a desktop without trayicon visible like Gnome Ubuntu, it will show if you use TopIcons gnome extension from extensions.gnome.org.

- GTK2 compatible
